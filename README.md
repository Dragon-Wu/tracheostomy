# Tracheostomy-for-burn-patients

The methodology of 《Development and validation of a deployable machine learning-based decision support system for tracheostomy in acute burn patients:  a cross-institutional retrospective cohort study》

## Introduction

Burns are one of the most common types of injury worldwide. Airway obstruction is a common emergency and death cause of severe burn patients during early phase, especially with inhalation injury. Tracheostomy is the most effective method to keep the patency of the airway and employ mechanical ventilation. However, the indication and decision of tracheostomy is always challenging for most medics. However, the indication of tracheostomy is challenging and controversial. Here, we aimed to develop and validate a deployable machine learning-based decision support system to predict the necessity of tracheostomy for acute burn patients.

## Method

We will upload all the code once our paper is published.

## Online calculator

An online calculator that can effectively estimate the necessity of tracheostomy for adult burn patients by inputting several clinical factors. The system has been validated by large-scale cross-temporal and cross-institutional studies in two top-tier hospitals in China.
